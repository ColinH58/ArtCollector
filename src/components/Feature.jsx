/**
 * We need a new component called Searchable which:
 *
 * Has a template like this:
 *
 * <span className="content">
 *  <a href="#" onClick={async (event) => {}}>SOME SEARCH TERM</a>
 * </span>
 *
 * You'll need to read searchTerm, searchValue, setIsLoading, and setSearchResults off of the props.
 *
 * When someone clicks the anchor tag, you should:
 *
 * - preventDefault on the event
 * - call setIsLoading, set it to true
 *
 * Then start a try/catch/finally block:
 *
 * try:
 *  - await the result of fetchQueryResultsFromTermAndValue, passing in searchTerm and searchValue
 *  - send the result to setSearchResults (which will update the Preview component)
 * catch:
 *  - console.error the error
 * finally:
 *  - call setIsLoading, set it to false

/**
 * We need a new component called Feature which looks like this when no featuredResult is passed in as a prop:

 *
 * <main id="feature">
 *   <div className="object-feature">
 *     <header>
 *       <h3>OBJECT TITLE</h3>
 *       <h4>WHEN IT IS DATED</h4>
 *     </header>
 *     <section className="facts">
 *       <span className="title">FACT NAME</span>
 *       <span className="content">FACT VALUE</span>
 *       <span className="title">NEXT FACT NAME</span>
 *       <span className="content">NEXT FACT VALUE</span>

 *     <section className="photos">
 *       <img src=IMAGE_URL alt=SOMETHING_WORTHWHILE />
 *     </section>
 *   </div>
 * </main>
 *
 * The different facts look like this: title, dated, images, primaryimageurl, description, culture, style,
 * technique, medium, dimensions, people, department, division, contact, creditline
 *
 * The <Searchable /> ones are: culture, technique, medium (first toLowerCase it), and person.displayname (one for each PEOPLE)
 *
 * NOTE: people and images are likely to be arrays, and will need to be mapped over if they exist
 *
 * This component should be exported as default.
